# SD A1111 B34T EmbLab

## Overview
SD A1111 B34T EmbLab is a simple embedding laboratory extension for the Stable Diffusion A1111 UI (SD1.5 version). This tool allows users to easily modify, merge, and create embeddings using groups of tokens.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by:
- A reuploaded clone: [embedding-inspector](https://github.com/w-e-w/embedding-inspector) of a deleted repository
- [stable-diffusion-webui-embedding-editor](https://github.com/CodeExplode/stable-diffusion-webui-embedding-editor.git)

## Features
- Merge embeddings by groups of prompts or combine all into one token
- Zonal editor tool for copying and pasting chunks of weights between tokens
- Pen tool for "drawing" weights on each token track
- Ability to change the accent of each token track and combine them into final tokens
- Save results as an Embedding (Textual Inversion)

## Use Cases
1. Create a single-token style by merging 4-5 tokens (e.g., "shine shock string detailed sharp")
2. Use the single-token adjustment to modify your prompt results
3. Duplicate a "token track," increase its accent, and use the pen tool to create an adjustment track
4. Combine tokens using parts of other token weights

## Notes
- This tool is designed for SD1.5 but can be used for experimentation and fun
- The interface may appear complex, resembling a sound editor
- While not a "magic box" solution, it offers flexibility for those who enjoy experimenting

## Getting Started
A video tutorial is available to help you understand the basics of this extension.
