it's an embedding laboratory extension where you can easily modify merge and create embeddings by bunch of tokens.

There you can merge it by groups of prompt what you have, or merge all into one token.

You have zonal editor tool where you can copy and paste chunks of weights between tokens in your embedding.

You have pen tool for just "draw" weights on each token-track.

You can change the accent of each token track and then combine it into finaly tokens to save as an Embedding (Textual inversion)

btw with this tool It's looks more like work in some sound editor.

this is not a tool for everyone, becouse it can looks a little bit complex, and there no some magic from a box, but you can have realy big fun of it, if you like to experiment.

for example you can create 1-token style by merging some 4-5 tokens like

"shine shock string detailed sharp"

and get some single-token adjustment to change the result of your prompt.

but also you can not just merge.

you can duplicate one of the "token track" incrase its accent and draw an adjustment track by pen tool for use this duplicated row as and adjuster for whole merge.

or just combine you single token by parts of other token weights, or any other variants. It's veryr flexible stuff tbh.

heare a videofile that provide basics for this extension.

works only for SD1.5 but who cares, it's just for fun and you can get it ) have a nice time!
